# Sensor Data Logger
Sensor Data Logger is a dashboard for your device sensors. It plots charts that show the values of selected sensors in real-time, even from connected Android Wear devices.

You can get the app from the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.steppschuh.sensordatalogger) or install the latest [apk file](https://github.com/Steppschuh/Sensor-Data-Logger/tree/master/Releases).

### Visualize all the data
The sensor data logger can display data from all generic sensor types, such as acceleration, force of gravity or magnetic field. In addition, it can visualize all device specific sensors that you might have, such as double tap, step detection or temperature.

### Android Wear support
Data from every sensor of connected Android Wear devices can be streamed to the app in real-time, even from multiple devices at once. Just open the app on your watch and you are good to go.

### Exporting in development
You'll be able to record and export the collected data to JSON or CSV files in an upcoming release.
